# PRODIGY_DS_02
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

# Summary

1. Total Passengers, Survivors, and Deaths:
   We calculated the total number of passengers on the Titanic.
   We determined the total number of survivors and the total number of deaths.


2. Survivors vs. Deaths Pie Chart:
   We created a pie chart to visually compare the proportion of survivors (37.7%) and deaths (62.3%) among the passengers.
   Passenger Class Distribution:
   We analyzed the distribution of passengers across different passenger classes (1st, 2nd, and 3rd class).
 
4. Average Age of Passengers:
   We calculated the average age of all passengers on the Titanic.

5. Survival Rate Based on Gender:
   We determined the survival rate based on gender, showing the percentage of male and female passengers who survived.

6. Survival Rate Based on Passenger Class and Gender:
   We analyzed the survival rates based on both passenger class and gender, highlighting how these factors influenced survival.

7. Average Fare Paid by Passenger Class:
   We calculated the average fare paid by passengers in each class (1st, 2nd, and 3rd class).

8. Survival Rate Based on Age and Gender:
   We examined the survival rate based on age and gender, categorizing passengers into age groups (0-18, 18-30, 30-50, and 50-80 years).

9. Survival Rate by Deck:
   We determined the survival rates by analyzing the deck locations of passengers' cabins.
   A bar chart was created to visualize the differences in survival rates among passengers on different decks.
 
   Each step in the analysis provides valuable insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival on the Titanic,   including demographics, passenger class, age, gender, and cabin location.
